            I’m a perfectionist focused on details. As much as I care about clean code I concentrate on useful transparent minimalistic design. These are two inseparable factors I always consider working on a website.
            So far I’ve been workin on landing pages and 3D web apps that help customers to understand the product better.
            <br><br>
            My current tech stack is: <strong>TypeScript, JS(ES6), Babylon.js, GSAP, Gulp, HTML/CSS</strong>. I’m keen on learning new skills and getting to know frameworks such as react and vue.js better.
            <br><br>
            I have worked for clients such as: Siemens, Dodge, Husqvarna and Burning Man Festival.
            <br><br>
            On a daily basis I’m responsible for the app architecture development and maintenance, interface implementation, features development, as well as taking care of core development decisions and strategy.
            <br><br>
            I work in Scrum and supervised projects myself using this methodology, that’s why while working as a developer, I know what questions needs to be asked to make the process easier and more effective.
            Besides, being a stickler for details I enjoy electronic music and good coffee.
